# python-api-challenge

This project is looking at weather versus the location.  Then using the weather patterns to plan a vacation.  

Using the WeatherPY, I used the weather API to find cities weather conditions.  I then use this data to compare the location against tempature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.  I used this data to see if there are correlations between the cities location and the 4 categories.

For the VacationPY, I used the city information exported from the WeatherPY.  Then I used my ideal weather conditions to narrow down to the list of cities I would enjoy to vacation.  Finally I used the geoapify API to find the locations of the closest hotels and mapped those findings.
